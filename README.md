Written in Node.js using Express.js framework.
I made this app mainly for the purpose of practicing Node.js.

TODO:
- Since I do not want to pay for a MongoDB instance in Heroku, I will instead develop a RESTful API service for this using Django Rest Framework on another instance, because PostgresSQL is free on Heroku. Also, to gain more knowledge in developing RESTful API.
- Populate the database quality data. Restaurant names must be proper.
- Use Google Maps API to calculate distances and to show directions.
- Add commenting service.
- All CRUD must be through an API.
